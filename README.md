## About

Given the St. Patrick's Day theme of the Hackathon, we decided to have some fun making a snake game in the theme of St. Patrick's Day. The story of Patrick banishing the snakes from the island of Ireland is a classic Irish tale and we felt that giving the game a Paddy's day twist was a great idea for a game. Surrounding the game, we also decided to add cool things like facts about St. Patrick's Day, Things to do on St. Patrick's Day during lockdown and a quiz!
